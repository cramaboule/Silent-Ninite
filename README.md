# Silent Ninite

There is a great tool called ninite (www.ninite.com)

The only problem is that it is not really 'silent'

So I wrote this little script to make it silent (like /S or /Silent or /quiet)

Just rename the downloaded 'Ninite ....... exe' into 'Ninite.exe' and place it into the same folder as the Ninite-silent.exe (my AutoIt prg) Run it and that's it !

Enjoy
